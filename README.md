# Sustainable Coding

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to, not only to strengthen my skills using HTML and CSS, but to show a real-world application of sustainable and inclusive code. It's incredibly important to keep attributes, such as "alt", in mind going forward with this profession so that we can continue to share our coding with those loved ones who may not be as able. 

## Usage

This project was a bit challenging for me, having no background in coding, but I am happy with my progress so far and hope to continue learning more about how to think about coding. I will definitely be using this project when I feel like I'm forgetting obvious elements/attributes.
